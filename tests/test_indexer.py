        'All data is stored and managed exclusively in either RAM or RAM + Flash Memory (Redis on Flash) and therefore, is at risk of being lost upon a\xa0process or server failure.\xa0As Redis Enterprise Software is not just a caching solution, but also a full-fledged database, persistence to disk is critical. Therefore, Redis Enterprise Software supports persisting data to disk on a per-database basis and in multiple ways. There are two options for persistence:  Append Only File (AOF) - A continuous writing of data to disk Snapshot (RDB) - An automatic periodic snapshot writing to disk  Data persistence, via either mechanism, is used solely to rehydrate the database if the database process fails for any reason. It is not a replacement for backups, but something you do in addition to backups. To disable data persistence, select None. AOF writes the latest ‘write’ commands into a file every second, it resembles a traditional RDBMS’s redo log, if you are familiar with that. This file can later be ‘replayed’ in order to recover from a crash. A snapshot (RDB) on the other hand, is performed every one, six, or twelve hours. The snapshot is a dump of the data and while there is a potential of losing up to one hour of data, it is dramatically faster to recover from a snapshot compared to AOF recovery. Persistence can be configured either at time of database creation or by editing an existing database’s configuration. While the persistence model can be changed dynamically, just know that it can take time for your database to switch from one persistence model to the other. It depends on what you are switching from and to, but also on the size of your database. Note: For performance reasons, if you are going to be using AOF, it is highly recommended to make sure replication is enabled for that database as well. When these two features are enabled, persistence is performed\xa0on the database slave and does not impact performance on the master. Options for configuring data persistence There are six\xa0options for persistence in Redis Enterprise Software:    Options Description     None Data is not persisted to disk at all.   Append Only File (AoF) on every write Data is fsynced to disk with every write.   Append Only File (AoF) one second Data is fsynced to disk every second.   Snapshot every 1 hour A snapshot of the database is created every hour.   Snapshot every 6 hours A snapshot of the database is created every 6 hours.   Snapshot every 12 hours A snapshot of the database is created every 12 hours.    The first thing you need to do is determine if you even need persistence. Persistence is used to recover from a catastrophic failure, so make sure that you need to incur the overhead of persistence before you select it. If the database is being used as a cache, then you may not need persistence. If you do need persistence, then you need to identify\xa0which is the best type for your use case. Append only file (AOF) vs snapshot (RDB) Now that you know the available options, to assist in making a decision on which option is right for your use case, here is a table about the two:    Append Only File (AOF) Snapshot (RDB)     More resource intensive Less resource\xa0intensive   Provides better durability (recover the latest point in time) Less durable   Slower time to recover (Larger files) Faster recovery time   More disk space required (files tend to grow large and require compaction) Requires less resource (I/O once every several hours and no compaction required)    Data persistence and Redis on Flash If you are enabling data persistence for databases running on Redis Enterprise Flash, by default both master and slave shards are configured to write to disk. This is unlike a standard Redis Enterprise Software database where only the slave shards persist to disk. This master and slave dual data persistence with replication is done to better protect the database against node failures. Flash-based databases are expected to hold larger datasets and repair times for shards can be longer under node failures. Having dual-persistence provides better protection against failures under these longer repair times. However, the dual data persistence with replication adds some processor and network overhead, especially in the case of cloud configurations with persistent storage that is network attached (e.g. EBS-backed volumes in AWS). There may be times where performance is critical for your use case and you don’t want to risk data persistence adding latency. If that is the case, you can disable data-persistence on the master shards using the following\xa0rladmin command: rladmin tune db db: master_persistence disabled     Page Contents   Options for configuring data persistence   Append only file (AOF) vs snapshot (RDB)   Data persistence and Redis on Flash',

Sample Application                 RedisBloom Tutorial   RedisBloom extends Redis core to support additional probabilistic data structures. It allows for solving computer science problems in a constant memory space with extremely fast processing and a low error rate. It supports scalable Bloom and Cuckoo filters to determine (with a specified degree of certainty) whether an item is present or absent from a collection.  The RedisBloom module provides four data types:  Bloom filter: A probabilistic data structure that can test for presence. A Bloom filter is a data structure designed to tell you, rapidly and memory-efficiently, whether an element is present in a set. Bloom filters typically exhibit better performance and scalability when inserting items (so if you\'re often adding items to your dataset then Bloom may be ideal).  Cuckoo filter: An alternative to Bloom filters, Cuckoo filters comes with additional support for deletion of elements from a set. These filters are quicker on check operations. Count-min sketch: A count-min sketch is generally used to determine the frequency of events in a stream. You can query the count-min sketch to get an estimate of the frequency of any given event.   Top-K: The Top-k probabilistic data structure in RedisBloom is a deterministic algorithm that approximates frequencies for the top k items. With Top-K, you’ll be notified in real time whenever elements enter into or are expelled from your Top-K list. If an element add-command enters the list, the dropped element will be returned.                                                     Step 1.

Getting Started with RedisBloom                                                    In the next steps you will use some basic RedisBloom commands. You can run them from the Redis command-line interface (redis-cli) or use the CLI available in RedisInsight. (See part 2 of this tutorial to learn more about using the RedisInsight CLI.) To interact with RedisBloom, you use the BF.ADD and BF.EXISTS commands.  Let’s go ahead and test drive some RedisBloom-specific operations. We will create a basic dataset based on unique visitors’ IP addresses, and you will see how to:  Create a Bloom filter Determine whether or not an item exists in the Bloom filter Add one or more items to the Bloom filter Determine whether or not a unique visitor’s IP address exists  Let’s walk through the process step-by-step:                                                   Create a Bloom filter                                                    Use the BF.ADD command to add a unique visitor IP address to the Bloom filter as shown here:      >> BF.ADD unique_visitors 10.94.214.120   (integer) 1   (1.75s)    Copy                                                     Determine whether or not an item exists                                                    Use the BF.EXISTS command to determine whether or not an item may exist in the Bloom filter:      >> BF.EXISTS unique_visitors 10.94.214.120   (integer) 1    Copy        >> BF.EXISTS unique_visitors 10.94.214.121   (integer) 0   (1.46s)    Copy   In the above example, the first command shows the result as “1”, indicating that the item may exist, whereas the second command displays "0", indicating that the item certainly may not exist.                                                   Add one or more items to the Bloom filter                                                    Use the BF.MADD command to add one or more items to the Bloom filter, creating the filter if it does not yet exist. This command operates identically to BF.ADD, except it allows multiple inputs and returns multiple values:      >> BF.MADD unique_visitors 10.94.214.100 10.94.214.200 10.94.214.210 10.94.214.212   1) (integer) 1   2) (integer) 1   3) (integer) 1   4) (integer) 1    Copy   As shown above, the BF.MADD allows you to add one or more visitors’ IP addresses to the Bloom filter.                                                   Determine whether or not a unique visitor’s IP address exists                                                    Use BF.MEXISTS to determine if one or more items may exist in the filter or not:      >> BF.MEXISTS unique_visitors 10.94.214.200 10.94.214.212   1) (integer) 1   2) (integer) 1    Copy         >> BF.MEXISTS unique_visitors 10.94.214.200 10.94.214.213   1) (integer) 1   2) (integer) 0    Copy   In the above example, the first command shows the result as “1” for both the visitors’ IP addresses, indicating that these items do exist. The second command displays "0" for one of the visitor’s IP addresses, indicating that the item certainly does not exist.
